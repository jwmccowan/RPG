Unity project to make a JRPG inspired take on the Pathfinder rule set.
This project is heavily in development and is not currently a viable product.  

If the base code looks familiar, much of the boiler plate code and architecture is inspired or used from the following blog as I learn about Unity and its systems.  It is an amazing blog that has taught me a lot about Unity, CSharp, and game architecture.
