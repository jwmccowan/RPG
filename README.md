Unity project to make a JRPG inspired take on the Pathfinder rule set.
This project is heavily in development and is not currently a viable product.  While the gameplay is more or less finished, there is not much content (I add more when I have the time), and the models that I use on my local environment are unable to be posted on GitHub, so the characters are all green blobs.  Either way, I think looking at the architecture and code style could be helpful for anyone looking to make a bit more involved Unity project.

If the base code looks familiar, much of the boiler plate code and architecture is inspired or used from the following blog as I learn about Unity and its systems.  It is an amazing blog that has taught me a lot about Unity, CSharp, and game architecture.
